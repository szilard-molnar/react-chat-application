The user has to type in his name, and the rooms name he wants to join. Once these are done, the user has to click "Sign In". Then the following screen appears:

The heading contains the room name, below that there is an automatic greeting message from the administrator. The bottom of this screen is the area where the user (in this case user1) can type in a message. The message can be sent by clicking Send, which will appear.

If another user wants to join our room, the only thing he needs to do is upon signing in he should enter the exact same room name that we created. Once it is done, our chat window lets us know that another user joined.

The second user will receive the same welcome message as the first user did upon joining.

During the chat we will receive the messages sent by the other user real time.

If if either user decides to log out, they just simply has to click the "X" button in top right corner which will log them out and takes them back to the opening page.
